# An Exploratory Study on Penetration Testing

Penetration Testing is the practice of simulating an authorized simulated attack
on a computer system, network or web application to find vulnerabilities that an attacker
could exploit. It involves gathering information about the target, finding possible entry
points, and attempting to break into the system. The objective of penetration testing is
for a business to find weaknesses within their system’s security and to assess the
overall health and security of a system. Typically, an outside security company is hired
to perform the penetration testing by breaking into the company’s system in the same
way an attacker would and reporting their findings. They are considered white hat
hackers as they attack ethically to help secure a company’s digital assets, while black
hat hackers will hack a company for personal or malicious gain. After the penetration
testing is complete, the findings are reported back to the company to determine the best
mitigation measures and patch up their systems to prevent hackers from exploiting
these vulnerabilities in the future.
